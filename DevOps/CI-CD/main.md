# What Happens When a Developer Commits to a Branch?

When a developer commits or pushes code to a branch, the CI/CD pipeline is triggered. This pipeline automates code integration, testing, and deployment to ensure high-quality and reliable software delivery.

---

## **Continuous Integration (CI)**

CI automates the integration and testing of new code to ensure it works seamlessly with the existing codebase. Here’s what happens step by step when a commit is made:

### 1. **Pipeline Trigger**
- A CI/CD tool (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI) detects the commit and triggers a predefined workflow.
- The workflow is defined in configuration files (e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

### 2. **Code Checkout**
- The CI server pulls the latest code from the branch into a clean environment (e.g., a virtual machine or container).

### 3. **Dependency Installation**
- The pipeline installs all required dependencies (e.g., using `pip install` for Python projects or `npm install` for JavaScript projects).

### 4. **Run Automated Tests**
- The CI server executes automated tests to validate the code:
  - **Unit Tests:** Check individual components.
  - **Integration Tests:** Verify interactions between components.
  - **End-to-End Tests:** Ensure the entire application functions as intended.

### 5. **Static Code Analysis (Optional)**
- Tools like `flake8` (for linting) or `mypy` (for static type checking) may be run to enforce code quality standards.

### 6. **Build Artifacts**
- For complex projects, CI compiles the code or packages it into deployable artifacts, such as:
  - Docker images
  - `.zip` or `.jar` files

### 7. **Results and Feedback**
- The CI system provides immediate feedback:
  - ✅ **Success:** All tests pass, and the build is valid.
  - ❌ **Failure:** Issues are reported, with logs to help debug.
- This ensures problems are caught and addressed early in development.

## **Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD)**

CD automates the deployment of tested code to a target environment. Depending on the setup, the process may involve **Continuous Delivery** or **Continuous Deployment**.

### **Types of Deployment**
- **Continuous Delivery:** Deploys code to a staging environment, requiring manual approval before production deployment.
- **Continuous Deployment:** Automatically deploys to production after passing all tests.

---

### **CD Pipeline Steps**

### 1. **Build the Application**
- If not already done in CI, the application is packaged into deployable artifacts:
  - Docker image
  - Binary file

### 2. **Push Artifacts to a Repository**
- The built artifacts are stored in a repository:
  - **Containerized Applications:** Images are pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).
  - **Non-Containerized Applications:** Artifacts are uploaded to an artifact repository (e.g., JFrog Artifactory).

### 3. **Deploy to Target Environment**
- The application is deployed to a specified environment:
  - Staging for testing and approval
  - Production for end-users
- Deployment targets might include:
  - Kubernetes clusters
  - AWS ECS/Fargate
  - Azure App Service
  - Bare-metal or virtual servers

### 4. **Run Post-Deployment Checks**
- **Health Checks:** Ensure the app is running correctly by hitting endpoints (e.g., `/health`).
- **Smoke Tests:** Verify basic functionality in the deployed environment.

### 5. **Notify the Team**
- The CD system notifies the team about the deployment status:
  - ✅ **Success:** Deployed successfully.
  - ❌ **Failure:** Alerts are sent with diagnostic logs for troubleshooting.

## **Key Benefits of CI/CD**
- **CI:** Catches integration issues early, maintains code quality, and ensures faster feedback loops.
- **CD:** Automates deployment, reduces manual effort, and ensures reliable delivery to staging or production environments.

With CI/CD, teams can iterate rapidly and maintain high software quality standards.
